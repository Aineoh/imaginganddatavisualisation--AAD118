# imaginganddatavisualisation--AAD118

Week 1
-------
This week was our introduction week. We were told about our 3 projects for this semester which are photographic, illustration and data visualisation. 

For our photography project we have to look at macro and micro pictures of a piece of architecture. We have to be creative with our photos and look at different angles and view points. Photography is something I really like but I've never been very good at. I have a Nikon d3200 and a Nikon coolpix but I only ever use them on automatic mode. This project is a great way for me to improve my photography skills and learn how to work my cameras. 

Week 2
--------
This week I went to Belfast castle and took some photos. It was a really good day so the photos came out really well. I took them using my Nikon cool pix which allowed me to zoom and capture alot of micro photography. Here is a link to [my flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/80894004@N03/sets/72157650857605852/) of all the photos I took that day. 

I looked into different photographers that I like in order to influence the photographs I was taking this week. One of my favourite photographers is [Diane Arbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus), even tho she is a protrait photographer some of her work can be used as inspiration for the micro side of this photography project.


This week in our lecture we looked at harmony and proportion within photographs. We looked at different photographers who all had different views and rules on how to take photos. 

Week 3
-------
This week we learned to look at different tone of voice for photos. 

how instagram and social media has changed photography

look at different photographers that use instgram exclusively. 

Week 4
-------
This week we had a talk by two guys from Fresh Made Media. There is an oppertunity for a paid placement over the summer which also lands you a garenteed placement in third year. 

This week we had a guest lecture from Richard Weston on art direction. He told us an art director doesnt make the product but garethers ideas and recognises a tone of voice for the desired product. Through art direction you can enhance the meaning of products. 

We were given our second project for this module this week. We have to design three book covers and were given a list of genres to choose from. I picked childrens classics. From what I gathered from Richards talk was that we have to plan all our book covers and gather alot of materials that inspire our vision.

This week we looked at different illustrators, local and worldwide, who all have different styles and how they fit different themes.

Today was the hand in for our book covers. I did two sets of covers because I coundlt commit to one direction I wanted to take. I choose to do Roald Dahl books. After doing my research into this style of book cover I realised all the covered were targeted at children. They had bright colours with the characters on the front. I decided to take the approach of targeting my covers for people my age who had read these book in their youth. I wanted them to look like classic book covers that would appeal to the older generation and could be seen as collectables.
