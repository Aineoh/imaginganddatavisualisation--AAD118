# imaginganddatavisualisation--AAD118

Week 1
-------
This week was our introduction week. We were told about our 3 projects for this semester which are photographic, illustration and data visualisation. 

For our photography project we have to look at macro and micro pictures of a piece of architecture. We have to be creative with our photos and look at different angles. 

Week 2
--------
This week I went to Belfast castle and took some photos. It was a really good day so the photos came out really well. I took them using my Nikon cool pix which allowed me to zoom and capture alot of micro photography. Here is a link to [my flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/80894004@N03/sets/72157650857605852/) of all the photos I took that day. 

I looked into different photographers that I like in order to influence the photographs I was taking this week. One of my favourite photographers is [Diane Arbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus), even tho she is a protrait photographer some of her work can be used as inspiration for the micro side of this photography project.


This week in our lecture we looked at harmony and proportion within photographs. We looked at different photographers who all had different views and rules on how to take photos.
