# imaginganddatavisualisation--AAD118

Week 1
-------
This week was our introduction week. We were told about our 3 projects for this semester which are photographic, illustration and data visualisation. 

For our photography project we have to look at macro and micro pictures of a piece of architecture. We have to be creative with our photos and look at different angles and view points. Photography is something I really like but I've never been very good at. I have a Nikon d3200 and a Nikon coolpix but I only ever use them on automatic mode. This project is a great way for me to improve my photography skills and learn how to work my cameras. 

This week I looked at the website [Photography Now](http://photography-now.net). I looked at [Ansel Adams'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams) work. I think his work is a good starting point for this project as his work is known widely and he has influenced many photographers. His landscapes show a really good composition which is good to know how to apply that to my own photos. I love how the light reflects on his photos, it adds depth to greyscale photos.

Week 2
--------
This week I went to Belfast castle and took some photos. It was a really good day so the photos came out really well. I took them using my Nikon cool pix which allowed me to zoom and capture alot of micro photography. Here is a link to [my flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/80894004@N03/sets/72157650857605852/) of all the photos I took that day. 

This week in our lecture we looked at harmony and proportion within photographs. We looked at different photographers who all had different views and rules on how to take photos. A photographer we looked at was [Hyeres Cartier-Bresson] (https://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/hyeres-cartier-bresson/). One of his most famous photos was deleted from flickr in a photo pool called 'Delete me'. This pool decides if photos are good enough to stay on the site. This shows that some feedback cant always be good.

I looked into different photographers that I like in order to influence the photographs I was taking this week. One of my favourite photographers is [Diane Arbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus), even tho she is a protrait photographer some of her work can be used as inspiration for the micro side of this photography project. I love how she looks at different people and has a very distinct photography style.

[Brett Weston](http://www.brettwestonarchive.com) is another photographer I found on [Photography Now](http://photography-now.net). His work is mostly close ups of nature. I like how he shoots nature photographs were the object doesnt look like it suppose to due to extreme close ups.

We had a workshop after our lecture today to show us how we should save our images for web. This was very benificial for me as it showed me how to get the best resolution at the smallest image size possible.  

Week 3
-------

This week we looked at how instagram and social media has changed photography. Images can be taken and uploades in a matter of seconds and everything has become very fast. This has also spawned a multitude of apps which allow users to apply filters, cropping photos and adding text. Everyone is a proffessional because its been made very simple. We see certain filters called 'Summer' and 'nostalgia' which provoke feelings for a photograph and have a certain tone of voice. 

![summer](http://static.splashnology.com/articles/Summer-Tutorials-Bundle-Photoshop-Guides-2013/23.jpg)

Smartphone photography is becoming incresingly mainstream. Having a camera on your phone is extremely handy and its compact size allows you to capture images on the go. The ability to upload images so quickly allows people to recieve gratitude and want to post more. The Instagram app allows anyone to capture images from around the world and share them immediately.

Instagram user @juliegeb from San Francisco takes photos of the cities beautiful colours and decorative details.

>“I like taking pictures of the urban walls that are a background to our life on the street. My aim is to show the beauty that >is living in the most commonplace of objects - doors and windows, or an interesting detail on a building.”

Week 4
-------
This week we had a talk by two guys from Fresh Made Media. There is an oppertunity for a paid placement over the summer which also lands you a garenteed placement in third year. 

This week we had a guest lecture from Richard Weston on art direction. He told us an art director doesnt make the product but gathers ideas and recognises a tone of voice for the desired product. Through art direction you can enhance the meaning of products. 

We looked at different art directors such as [Josef Muller-Brockmann](http://www.typetoken.net/icon/josef-muller-brockmann-lars-muller-publishers-poster-collection-25/) who is known for his simple design. 

We looked at art director [Coralie Bickford-Smith](http://cb-smith.com) who design book covers as a series.

We looked at movie sequence titles which I really enjoyed. My favorite opening titles are from American Horror Story as the really capture a feeling about the program and use imagery which is really relevant to the theme.

We were given our second project for this module this week. We have to design three book covers and were given a list of genres to choose from. I picked childrens classics. From what I gathered from Richards talk was that we have to plan all our book covers and gather alot of materials that inspire our vision. 

We were given our new project this week which was to design three book covers from one of the following genres: 

* Horror
* Romance
* Crime & thrillers
* Science Fiction & fantasy
* Children's classics
* Alternatively, you could choose one author and look at a range of their books

Week 5
------

This week we looked at different illustrators, local and worldwide, who all have different styles and how they fit different themes. I have been doing alot of research on my own this week. I have chosen to do three books by Roald Dahl. I am doing Fantastic Mr For, The Witches and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. My reasons for choosing these books is because I read them as a child and I want to created book covers for them that are relatable to older genration who remember them as children. 

Firstly I looked at the book covers that Roald Dahl currently has on offer. I did this to see what I could do differently. 

![Roald dahl books](http://stmichaelscatholicprimary.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dahl-2.jpg)

One of my favourite book illustrators is Mary Blair and I want to use influence from her work in my design.

His books are aimed heavily at children but I wanted to create a market for people my age and the books could be seen as collectables, or limited edition. I really liked the characters on the covers as I'm a big fan of Quinten Blake, but I thought I would do my own take on them. I did some research on the type of style I wanted.

![book 1](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/8c/1e/01/8c1e0146a460807f83b36e301e850851.jpg)
![book 2](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/13/84/12/1384124c8eeafca3f8a34ab05a37d1b3.jpg)

I really liked the old style [penguin book covers](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/da/11/b3/da11b3f51c09039cf0cce330d4059c82.jpg) and wanted to use that template to design my book covers. I also really like flat style design and I havent seen anything like that for Roald Dahl book covers before.

Today was the hand in for our book covers. I did two sets of covers because I couldn't commit to one direction I wanted to take. I choose to do Roald Dahl books. After doing my research into this style of book cover I realised all the covered were targeted at children. They had bright colours with the characters on the front. I decided to take the approach of targeting my covers for people my age who had read these book in their youth. I wanted them to look like classic book covers that would appeal to the older generation and could be seen as collectables.

We were given our third and final project today for this module. We have to create an infographic about the population of the world. This is going to be the most challenging project for me as I will have to organise all the data and present it in a way thats user friendly and will be easy to follow.  

Week 9 
-------

This week I looked at different infographic/ data visualisation styles. 

![foot infographic](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/474x/84/07/40/840740f8386fe9f4afbeb01680550a8f.jpg)

I liked this style, were they use pointilism and the size of points to represent what is used most in the chart. As our project is population I think this would be great to use inside the world.
